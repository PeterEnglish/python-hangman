# python-hangman
A command-line based hangman game written in python

## Description
I built this game to refresh on a few core principles in python - in this case, functions and string manipulation.
The game runs by looping to get guesses (input), and responding appropriately to the guess.
For example:  By informing the player of a wrong guess and updateding the hangman graphic.

## Project Status
Completed, but perhaps there might be scope to turn this into a gui-based game using tKinter or pygame.
